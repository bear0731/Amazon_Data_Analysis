Just wore it for the first time today.  When I first got it, it felt weird and was kind of scratchy.  I washed it and put it in the dryer.  It did shrink a bit, but I like the fit better and while the arms became just a bit short, it doesn't bother me as I cuff them anyway.  But the great part is that it came out soft and comfy.  It's like having a brand new favorite old shirt.  Its something I will be able to wear year round.  The colors are nice and there was no fade when I washed it.  I usually wear large, but bought XL because I figured it would shrink.  If I had wanted it more of an oversized shirt, I would have bought 2XL hope that's helpful sizewise.

I’ll try to add a picture later. I’m 5 foot 3, about 145 pounds. I bought the Medium. It fits really well, Super flattering. I have just purchased a couple more in different colors (blue and white) it is the perfect shirt for work. I sit and talk with people most of the day. Due to the shape of the shirt, I never have to worry if I am “hanging out” or if my mummy tummy (of 4) is sticking out… it just looks nice, does not seems to wrinkle at all. I wash mine on cold and immediately hang to dry and have not needed to iron. I only took one star off because I had hoped the fabric would be a tad softer. Linen can be nice, but this one is a tad rough- not horrible. It’s fine I wear it with a tank underneath and without- so it’s fine, but it’s not silky or cotton. The color was vibrant, lovely- I tucked just the front into my jeans and it gives a great look. Highly recommend this shirt.

I wanted a linen shirt, but linen clothing will wrinkle if you look at them funny.  I was hesitant to buy this because I worry about buying clothing online before I get a chance to try them on beforehand.This shirt is fantastic.  It has that linen look, without the high maintenance of linen.  I like that I can dress it up with a blazer, or without for a more casual look.  It straddles both look seamlessly.  I've taken this shirt on vacation where I had to wear it without the benefit of ironing it, and it looks fine.  The polyester keeps it from wrinkling too much.The only negatives are the sleeve lengths and the length of the shirt.  I'm not a tall, nor big person.  The size small fits me perfectly, but the sleeves can use an extra inch.  The hem length can use about 2 more inches so that it doesn't untuck so easily.

I love this blouse. I purchased the white with stripes. The fit is loose without looking too boxy and true to size. The fabric is soft, light and flowy, and super comfortable. Tucked in or loose, open front or layered over another shirt, it looks trendy and cute. I personally didn’t like it layered under a sweater but that’s just not my style.

I read reviews that said to size up, shrinkage being an issue even with hand washing and hanging to dry. So I bought an x-tra large. And it was too big even after washing it in the machine on warm and drying on low. Next I bought a large, but it was still too big. I ended up buying a medium, machine washed it on cold and dried it in the dryer on low. No shrinking!  I’m pretty sensitive to fabrics, clothing tags, etc.  I thought they were actually quite soft. So I would say these run true to size, are quite soft and tolerated machine washing on cold and drying on low in the dryer without shrinking. I wil be purchasing more colors.

This shirt did not fit as described by the reviews or the size guide. I ordered the white shirt and the color was not consistent at all. The sleeves were more of an off white. The quality of the shirt was awful. I very much wanted to like this shirt, I had been waiting for it to go on sale and I bought it as soon as it did. Overall it was a miss.

I usually wear an xl, so that's what I got. To achieve the loose/oversized look, you'll need to upsize. Nice material and beautiful purple color. I will be returning for the bigger size as I want a looser fit.

I do like this shirt...it is a bit thin and does run small. I can usually wear a medium, but I ordered a large and it is still tight. Like a lot of Chinese made clothing the sizing is often off.  Otherwise a good value for what it is.

As other reviewers have said the white is not bright as in the photo on the model but rather a yellowish white sort of an aged look. I would have preferred white but I do like the top so I’m going to keep it. If you were looking for an actual white I would keep looking and bypass this one.EDIT: I washed in Tide Oxy and it whitened up nicely. Not a Snow White but definitely no more yellow.

I’m usually a small in shirts, especially baggy. So I sized up to a medium considering other reviews. Wish I had gone up to a large for the oversized baggy fit.

I was looking for an oversized linen like shirt to go over swimwear and tops in very hot weather.  It is an odd cut and it is very short.  I love white.  This came tea/cream.  I did boil it in Rit Color remover and it came closer to white.  I would have liked it more if it were more sheer.  The biggest problem is that I ordered it very large (two sizes too big) so that it would be longer and more of a coverup instead of a shirt.  The shirt was blousy but it was very short.  I made it work but it is not my favorite.  Meh..

I bought this in the orange-red and the black. The orange-red is just red, so it’s not like the image shown. The black is fine. I washed it on the wrinkle reducer setting and it looks great. Sad about the other shirt as that’s the one I was excited about.

This is a beautiful shirt.. BUT it shirks a lot! Washed on cold, dried in low as specified but this shrank so much that I can’t even button it. I wear a M or L depending on style. Went with a large because I wanted it over sized, which it was before washing.  So either don’t put in dryer or go 2 sizes bigger if you want it to fit

Although the title of this item reads ""Linen"", it most definitely is not.  That is, upon close examination, actually spelled out in the description on the Amazon ad.Although the photo shows the blouse as being a perky sky blue, it's actually a very very pale blue .. with a grey tinge and very light colored.  Definitely not a brilliant uplifting sky blue as I'd hoped.It drapes nicely (I'm 5'1"" and 150lb)  washes well (cold water, hang to dry) and irons easily.  It's comfy to wear and I DO like it and will keep it, but sadly, it's not what I signed up for.

This is a nice enough shirt, was flattering in it's design.  However the construction was wanting.  Threads were unclipped and worst of all buttons were missing.  If you are looking for a white shirt as it is listed in the description, this is not the white shirt you expect.  It's more off white or ivory, colors I don't do well in, so with all that back it went.

I never write reviews, but this shirt deserves one. I was a little worried about ordering this shirt because of the ""often returned"" warning on it, but I'm so glad I did! It's one of my favorite shirts now! I absolutely love the linen look.I ordered the gray, which is more like a light tan in real life (I tried to edit the picture to be as close as possible to its actual color - it's a little less orangey in real life, but it's pretty close). I got the medium (bust 35, waist 33) and it's the perfect size for me.Some of the reviews said the material is scratchy, and it is a bit, but it's not a problem for me. I could see how it would bother people with more sensitive skin though. I washed it on cold and laid it flat to dry and didn't experience any shrinkage at all. There is some slight wrinkling and a little bit of pilling, but those are minor things.Overall, this is a great shirt! I would definitely consider getting it in a different color later on:)

The fabric of the white shirt is very soft and comfortable.I am 5""7"", 110 ish, 34A.I got the shirt in Small.I am disappointed that you can see my white bra through it.I wore it this past week with a black tank under it, which looked fine and coordinated with black pants.Maybe an ecru bra would not show, but I still wish it were a bit less sheer.Overall, I do like this shirt, though.It is versatile.Leave a couple of buttons at the top and bottom undone and tie the ends together.Button most or all the buttons and tuck in part or all of the shirt - or leave it untucked like I did.Leave all the buttons undone and leave the shirt open with a tank or T under it.It really is nice fabric, and these shirts can be worn for many occasions.Use pants/skirt, shoes, belt and other accessories to change the look for more formal or casual events.I do recommend these shirts and am glad I got this.

I wanted to like this shirt. I’m a small but ordered a medium so it would be oversized. It was tight in shoulders & upper arm. There is a strange seam going across the middle back.  It’s a button down not a v-neck and there are no buttons for rolled sleeves.  For a ‘linen’ shirt, it’s actually polyester.

This was perfect the day I got it. I got a size up (L) because I wanted a more casual feel. One wash/dry and it’s virtually a small, with the sleeves now falling between my elbow and wrist, and the bottom hits me at my waist. Not hips, waist.So, I bought a second one and went two sizes up (XL). Washed it on cold, hung it to dry, and it still shrunk. This one now fits like a medium, which is still not what I wanted either.Third time was the charm. I  found the perfect size in an XXL! Keep in mind, I’m an everyday M, 5’6, 135 lbs, 34C.  I immediately washed & dried it and it’s absolutely perfect— I finally have the perfect linen shirt and look. I will definitely purchase more colors.

I liked the shirt, the quality of the material is great. The first time I wore the blouse it was a little scratchy.  You should order a size up. Based on the reviews, I ordered the XL. I'm 5 feet 2 and 159 pounds and I normally wear a large, this fit me perfectly. My only issue is I washed the shirt and put it in the dryer (big mistake). It shrank, not so much that I can't wear it; but, it shrank enough to be noticeable to me. All in all, I will order another one, I just want put it in the dryer.

I got this in the striped and the light blue in a size Large (I’m usually between M-L depending on brand and fit) because I wanted it to be more loose, not fitted. I love the striped one! Fits great, hangs nicely on the body, is a nice light soft flowy material, and the colors are exactly what I expected. However, the blue one is a different material. I could tell as soon as I picked it up that it felt thicker and heavier and…stiffer? I can’t even tell you how well it fit, because as soon as I put it on I could feel myself getting all itchy and had to immediately take it back off. Take that with a grain of salt, as I have very sensitive skin and am very picky about the feel of my clothes (unfortunately can’t wear anything with even 1% wool, for example). So I’m not saying it’s an itchy material, just that the material seems to vary greatly from one color to another.

I picked this when I searched for linen shirts.  Don’t get me wrong..The shirt I received is very nice..looks like linen, almost feels like linen but definitely not linen.  I read the description and to my surprise it’s a mix of polyester and spandex, not the natural fabric that I wanted and needed. I take fault in this but it is misleading when you search linen shirts.

So this is my third shirt from this company. I have had no issued at all with quality. I have a white shirt, a black shirt and now the stripped one. They all fit the same and are great for dressing up or down. I like the linen feel of them.  My only gripe with the stripped shirt is the color. It might be my computer but I felt the background of the shirt was more of a very light gray and when the shirt arrived it was white with the stripes. But the colors of the stripes were spot on and honestly it's  cute. so that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that, very happy

I got this shirt for a cover up to wear on the motorcycle on hot sunny days: the material is a little on the thicker side without much stretch, just a little snugger than I would like on my upper arms, but that’s a problem I often have since my previously muscular arms are getting chubbier with age. Feels and looks like a very good quality shirt, not see thru, but you would want a nude bra or cami under it I think. The color is a creamy white/ivory with linen-look detailing in the fabric. Length is on the longer side for me, but I’m only 5’2” so most things are: comes just past my butt. Blouse is cut nicely, but not a slim fit, so works well with my extra 10 pounds. I have not washed it yet, tag states to hand wash & not to dry, so I will try that and will update post if it shrinks or becomes really wrinkly as some blouses do when you can’t dry them. For reference, I bought a medium and it seems to be true to size, comparable to a 6-8.UPDATE:  I recently bought a second one of these shirts in the dark blue and the only con was that the buttons did not match the shirt: they were white, which I wasn’t real crazy about, but will keep as a casual shirt. I have washed these on delicate/hand wash cycle, fluffed on air dry with 2 fabric softener sheets, and hung to dry the rest of the way. They did not seem to shrink and any additional wrinkles I steamed out.

This shirt far exceeded my expectations . The fit is perfect for me, length, shoulder width and sleeve length. It looks much more luxurious than the price tag would indicate. Wrinkles came out easily with a quick ironing.I’m 5’3, 138#, broader shouldered, and ordered a medium. Similar shirts are so very long but this works well tucked or untucked.

The blue colour  and material are classy. It wrinkles but that’s what linen does. Good value. I haven’t washed it yet but I think it will hold up.

I order this because I’m looking for something to put over my T-shirt. I don’t want to expose my arm inside and outside the house. So I was looking for something very light material. This is not light material. Kind of heavy for my purpose. It’s a good quality material but it’s not what I’m looking for. I’m also looking for white and this is not white at all. It’s more of light cream. I can see some reviews with the same comments. Other than that it’s ok. If you want a little oversized you need to size up.

I like this shirt. It's loose enough but not baggy, the color is as expected and it packs nicely for travel. The material was very icky when taking it out of the package but after washing (which I do before wearing) it softened a bit and looks much better. I have a feeling it'll soften over time. It's not linen but does mimick it - even unwashed, undried linen feels stiff and uncomfortable - which is nice since linen can be expensive. The fit is pretty accurate - I'm 5""9, 150lbs with larger breasts and it lays nicely. Only issue, I tend to ignore the dry clean idea when it comes to clothing purchased on Amazon but definitely heed that warning - I dried in delicate and the sleeves shrunk by several inches. Not a big deal to me as I roll the sleeves up the majority of the time but it was shocking how much they shrunk. Still, that was my error and not the manufacturer.

I didn’t really care for it appears to be like in flowing and it’s very stiff and kind of itchy on the skin and it’s also that type of fabric that attracts lint very easily, and when I washed it, it was even worse. I had to get a lint brush and like literally push down hard to get it free of lint. I just thought it was going to be a light cotton but not that you could wear like with the tank underneath open or you know versatile… But it’s not a comfortable shirt at least not for me. and anyone who is in menopause out there it’s not going to be for you either. Lol.

It would get 5 stars if it weren't that the sleeves are probably 4 inches too short on me. I'm 5'6"" about 125 lb. and ordered a small. Fits perfectly on my torso and in overall length, but the sleeves end literally 3 inches above by wrist, so I'll have to always wear it with them rolled. Despite this, I'll probably get another as it is really cute and versatile.

When I tried it on, I was concerned that the sleeves might be too long. I washed it and now the sleeves are too short.  I have to roll up the sleeves to wear it. Of course the over-all length of the blouse has also shrunk.  That makes it hard to tuck the way I was hoping. Barely enough fabric to keep it in the front of my pants. I normally wear a small, but a Medium would have been a better fit.

I love the way this shirt fits.  I normally wear shirts that are large-XL, depending on the style, but I ordered a 2XL in this ""Astylish Womens V Neck Roll up Sleeve Button Down Blouse"" in Khaki.  Usually khaki and tan colors are hit and miss for me, but this is a nice, warm khaki that really compliments natural hair and skin color.  The shirt is well fitted though the shoulders and chest, with just enough room for my chubby upper arms to be comfortable and move freely while I move around and lift my arms. The shirt is perfect length for me, but some people with a long torso may find it a little short. The sleeve length is fine for me, but barely; they border on too short. I got this shirt to be worn tucked in with slacks to the office and it looks fantastic.  The fabric IS itchy and stiff upon arrival, but a cold wash on gentle cycle and hang to dry helped improve the texture.  It will never feel like a soft cotton shirt, it will always feel more like a medium thickness linen, even though it isn't linen. Wrinkles seem to fall out easily when hung in the bathroom, a big improvement over real linen or even linen blends I have had in the past.  I heeded the advice of other reviewers and have never put this in the dryer or washed on warm, but I'm also not willing to dry clean it all the time.

This is a really nice blouse, until you wash it.  It did hang beautifully, and comfortably when on.  The brown was slightly see thru, but could be worn alone.  It had a nice loose fit.  But not baggy.  Just right.  My biggest complaint is how much it shrunk when washed.  I washed it by hand in cold water and hung it up to air dry.It shrunk about 1/2 a size and is now a bit clingy to the body.  And just a little scratchy now.

I ordered the light brown option and immediately noticed the color did not match the photo but was definitely more dark brown (see close up photo for most accurate color match). Also they run small. I am 4'10' and 130lb, usually wear a small. I think I'll order a larger size and try a different color as I liked the material and cut.

I wanted these to use as a light over shirt. I read most of the reviews. Here’s mine.I am 5’2” 180, weight in middle, bust and stomach. XL fit good for my purpose. Cannot button at bust, But nice and loose otherwise. Love the back detail. Washed in cold, line dry, no shrinkage.White is off white. Grey is more taupe tan. Not what I call grey.  Lt kaki is more peachy tan. I’ll use them all. Hope this review helps.

Really nice fabric but NO stretch— I’m a busty gal and the buttons gapped with my regular size, so I’m returning and getting a size up. It was perfectly fitted around the shoulders so I’m hoping it’ll be a looser, breezier fit by going up.I was surprised that it was thicker fabric than I expected— was hoping to wear it during the summer but I think it’s better for early summer/early fall, not 100 degree weather like we’re having now.

I am 5.6 and 150lbs, thought a Large will be loose enough. It is tight! I think I need to size up... Be aware, the white is more of an unbleached white, not the bleached, crisp white, therefore, I matched it with black or brown pants. Otherwise, lightweight fabric, more for casual wear.

I bought this top thinking of wearing with a tank and shorts.  This top is too heavy (polyester) for a summer top/ cover up.  I would say that it would be nice for a work top with dress pants.  I am a true size XXL or size 18 on top 40DD and I got the 2XL and it was a perfect fitted look, size up if you want a baggy look.  I returned it because it took a long time to arrive and in the meantime I found the perfect linen button up for the summer.

I love these shirts. I have a bunch of them. HOWEVER - I have really long arms and had to order a size up because once I washed the smalls, they shrunk and I can only wear them if I roll up the sleeves.Also, if you have a longer torso, if the shirt fits when you first get it, likely it will shrink upon washing (we wash in cold and don't dry these and they still shrink).If you're looking at the shirts with designs, you need to know they're appliquéd. They're not sewn on as the pictures suggest. If that's a problem (I wouldn't have kept them, but my wife loved them so much), then don't choose the sunflowers or whatever. Choose the solid ones or the striped ones.

Right out of the package I’m pleased. I’m 5’10” 220lb and DD chest. I usually go with size XL but glad I bought this in XXL, gives me barely the oversized look and doesn’t pull in the chest. (WYKYK) clearly it’s more offwhite than white but not as yellow as some of the other reviews indicate.

While it fit well, the fabric & shade of purple was a disappointment. I’d hoped- from the picture- that it would be a darker plum shade, not the bright purple it is.  Doesn’t look right with the outfit I’d envisioned. The fabric was supposedly a cotton polyester blend.  It looks & feels like linen & is a high maintenance shirt that requires special care . I washed it in cold water & ironed it & it looks nice, but not looking forward to ironing job the next time I wash it. This is exactly why I rarely order clothing online….it’s often disappointing & I dislike driving the hour round trip to the ups store to return it.

Really cute shirt. It is a wee bit scratchy but nothing that bothers me to the point of returning it. I have not washed it yet either so I expect it to soften a bit. It's really flattering!  I ordered the gray and it is a gray/khaki color. Really pretty. Quality seems to be good. The detail in back feels more feminine and it helps hide any back fat or booty fat. I bought an XL. I'm a size 12 but a 38H bra and it doesn't gap at the buttons.  Right now it fits perfectly. I don't know if it will shrink when washed but I'll likely not dry it or dry on Low delicate. I'm a fan and will probably buy in another color too.

I bought this by mistake, thinking it was 100% cotton.  It is not, and in the Florida heat, there is no way I wanted to wear woven polyester, even if it does not look like polyester.  But the top is so flattering, the drape so perfect, that despite starting a return on this, I decided to keep it.  It looks smart-casual, and works tucked or not.  I ended up also buying a 100% cotton shirt from a catalog at three times the price and I assure you, I do not like it as much.  I am looking forward to cooler temperatures or travel to don this one.  I am 5'1"" 32D and a small works well.  No gaping at the bust holes.

I almost didnt get this shirt. The pics from some of these reviews showed a wrinkled mess right out of the bag. It just didnt look flattering. Then i found one nicely ironed tan color version review and decided to just try it. SO glad i did. The shirt is so adorable. I picked the white, and yet its white, not cream. I picked the thicker version and its the perfect feel, thickness and size. The shirt is NOT LINEN, but looks like it. I steamed the wrinkles out, tucked half the front in and paired with with jeans, a brown belt and some cute brown mules and outfit complete! Loved it so much, i ordered a Khaki one too!

I love the material. I bought 2 in different colors and I am ordering for my 3rd color. I am 5ft and 105lbs. Small size is not small nor too big for me.i It's very comfy to wear on cold weather and during summer because of the material. I wash it separately and make sure use fabric softener to be soft and not scratchy like others mentioned. Although, if you have long arms and prefer to not fold the sleeves then it might be too short for you.

This shirt is okay. It runs small, I wish I would have sized up to have more room. The sleeves are short! They don't even reach my wrist so I have to cuff the sleeves so it doesn't look strange and I won't be able to style it the way I had envisioned with the sleeves poking out from cardigan sleeves at the wrist. I wouldn't recommend this shirt.

I'm 5'6"" and 145lbs.  I first got Large but sent them back before washing. Got 6 colors in XL, and they fit good after hand washing and drip-drying.  I don't want clingy tight.  I like it to blouse at the waist.  I also like that there's just enough stretch to push the sleeves up without having to unbutton the cuffs.  The light blue color isn't as bright a blue as I was expecting, more of a light denim hue.

I was immediately impressed with the straight, even stitching and the fact that both arms, shoulders, and length were symmetrical, everywhere. It feels slightly scratchy at first try-on, but I’m sure it just needs a washing with a bit of fabric softener. I bought the multi-colored peach/cream/ brown and now that I’ve seen and touched the fabric I’ll be buying another in solid cream. I tend to wear a wireless soft bra, rather than a constructed bra, so light-colored fabrics are sometimes a “no.” This one is a “yes.”True to size, the Large fits a 40 to 41” bust (I’m small across the back, that could possibly cause tightness if you have a larger back) and the arms are the correct length for my 5’4”, 134 lbs body.I wouldn’t send this through the dryer (shrinkage alert) except for a low-heat quick trip to remove any wrinkles left over from washing.PS if between sizes on the chart listed for this brand, I’d size up. I’ll likely try the XL for my next purchase to be able to toss in the dryer on delicate with no worries.

Soft material nice and flowing.  Bought XL which worked great as an oversized blouse then mistakenly dried it. Now it’s perfect as a regular blouse.  Will buy more!

I love the blue on white print but I’m not impressed with the way it washes up. I have other styles that are easier care. It’s “okay” but not a favorite.

Pleasantly surprised by the subtle texture of this shirt. It’s quite flattering. It is the tiniest bit sheer, but I remain delighted with this purchase.

The fabric is lovely and the style is very nice. Expect it to shrink an entire size if using the dryer. This shirt is a very fitted style and sizing which is what I was going for.
