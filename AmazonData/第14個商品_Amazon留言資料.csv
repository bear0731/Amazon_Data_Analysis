Quality cotton with stretch, color is great (ordered it in other colors as well), cut is nice and slim but long which is so nice for taller people. Lighter color is slightly see through but the puffs on the sleeves are a fun addition.

I wanted to love this top (ordered white and black) but it’s too form fitting for my “fluffy” mid section. It’s very stretchy and the fabric is a nice weight and very soft, the sleeve detail is super cute too.

Looking for a cute cotton-ish t-shirt that had a little extra something, I found this one. And I love it! It's spot on sizing. A nice little bit of stretch. Slight shine to the fabric so it does look a little fancier than just a cotton t. I paired it with shorts and overalls. Great shirt if you want puffy sleeves.

This top is super cute! It feels very soft and is very comfortable. The sleeves are unique and may not sit well under certain jackets or sweaters. It has done well through the wash/dryer multiple times now. No major signs of wear. The only thing I’m not crazy about is the length. It feels a bit long. It can always be tucked in but I’m not someone who likes to do that very often.

I’m into puff sleeves. For decades. Glad they’re “coming back”. This fit to size but on the baggier side, which I like for tucking. It’s elevated casual tshirt. Not the thickest or thinnest fabric. Good stretch.

I liked this top when I purchased it. It was a nice weight and fit. I've had it about 6 months and worn it maybe 6 or 7 times now. The last time I packed it for a business trip I realized that it had a small hole in the front, so now I will have to throw it out, as it's in a place where the hole would be easily noticed.

This is a very comfortable shirt. I like the sleeves as it makes this shirt a little more dressy than the average tee shirt. It can be dressed up, or down. It’s very versatile. I ordered this shirt in all different colors. I accidentally ordered the wrong size on one of them. I gave it to a friend who fell in love with this shirt as well, and another friend wanted one so I ended up ordering even more. It’s a great shirt! It’s well worth the money. This shirt is perfect for my capsule closet.

I got the olive green/with hint of turquoise, white/all white with no panels of off-white (as per some reviews), and black/always my favorite. I usually get a small or medium, but this top is a bit more fitted than I like. The opening for the arms is pretty wide, not including the fact that the sleeves are definitely puffy. I’m not very girly girl, but I didn’t think the puffy sleeves was too extreme. I’m planning to keep the black one for sure, and see how it washes and shrinks before I decide if I’m keeping all three in this size. *edit: Minimal shrink. Decided to keep all 3. Pretty wrinkled out of the dryer, so you’ll need to hang right away or iron. I put a photo showing the white is a bit see-through on my back with a grey bra.  For reference, I got a size medium and I am tall and skinny (5’9” and 130lbs).

I like this t-shirt. It's cute and comfortable. I ordered it in white and I don't think it's sheer like some of the other reviews mentioned. I ordered a large which is standard for me. I'm 5'7"" / 155lbs. I have washed it and it seems to be holding up pretty well. Many of the Amazon shirts start pilling early. I give it a thumbs up and I may be ordering more in other colors.

I would buy this shirt over and over and recommend that all viewers should buy it. I have worn this shirt to so many places and have received so many compliments on it. I work in a school and I dislike ironing, but this shirt does not require ironing.  The sleeves are a bit longer to help with those chilly mornings outside.

This top is really cute but I didn't expect it to fit so tight and close throug the body. I usually comfortably wear a L/XL and this was skin tight. I was expecting a regular fitting t-shirt with cute sleeves and this is not that at all. Not the fit I was looking for so I'm going to try it in an XXL because otherwise the shirt is actually pretty cute.

I like this shirt so much. I’ll probably buy another in a different color. Did go up one size as I like a little room between my body and clothes. You won’t regret buying it!

This top is just what I was looking for! I wanted something to pair with high waisted skirts, but a little nicer look for work than a basic tee. The twist in the sleeve is so cute! The fabric is soft and not sheer or see through.Overall, it fits true to size. It is meant to be fitted, which worked well for wearing with a skirt. But it’s tighter than I’d wear with pants or shorts. I wear size XL-XXL/22-24, for reference.Will definitely be buying in different colors!

I ordered this and one other shirt with puffed sleeves. I don’t know if it has anything to do with the fact that I tried them on back-to-back, but this shirt receivers an “80s bridesmaid” comment from my husband. Granted, he’s not exactly a fashion guru, but seeing as it’s 2023, those are not the vibes I’m looking to project. I ended up sending this one back.

The fabric is a nice weight, and the construction seems to be okay. I would say the item runs true to size, but is a slim/body skimming fit. I have not washed it, so I don't know how it will hold up. If you're interested in a relaxed fit or are very busty, I would recommend sizing up. The twist on the sleeves is a cute detail and is similar to another shirt I bought from a different retailer for far more money; however, the sleeves are an awkward length. The twisted band hits right at the largest part of my bicep, which is not the most flattering. I also think the shirttail is very long, but I'll probably wear this tucked into skirts, so that's not a huge deal, but I could never wear it untucked. The price is good, and it is a step up from a basic T. I'd say it's worth the $12.50 price tag, but I'm glad I didn't pay more.

I absolutely love this shirt! It is so cute and the material is so nice. You can tell this will last more than one season. The length is great, too - nice and long so you don’t have to worry about it not covering you. Sizing that is recommended is good. The shirts must run small. I usually wear a L and was recommended to buy an XL, which I did and am glad I went that route. I’d highly recommend this shirt!

I’m obsessed with this t-shirt. I bought the gray in size large, and love it.

Very cute! I love that it’s made of comfortable and durable cotton and modal rather than polyester. The slight puff of the sleeves is very flattering and will help me to dress up my comfy summer outfits. People with sensory issues might not like the feel of the knot on their upper arm, but it doesn’t bother me much. The shirts are quite long and will probably need to be tucked in. Im 5’4”, measurements 40”, 31”, 42”, and the medium fits me like a glove. It doesn’t appear to have shrunk noticeably after running it through the dryer on high. The orange is much darker and brighter than pictured.

I like the fit of this top.  At 5' 4"" 119lbs. the medium fit great.  The sleeves are a little more bulky than I imagined they would be, but I got used to them. It does not bind and there are no itchy tags. A good buy for the price.

This shirt fits a bit small for a large. Sleeves fall a little wonky. Doesn’t seem super high quality, and color is thick like a Hanes shirt. Bummed.

The sleeves were bigger than I expected, so I may just wear it for dressier occasions. The round neck is fantastic! Most round necks are too small.

If you are looking for a black tee but tired of being basic? Try this shirt. The twist in the sleeve brings it up a notch.I haven't washed it so not sure how it will survive. Will update later. 🙃

I LOVE...LOVE...LOVE this blouse.  Finally a feminine looking blouse that can go with dressier pants, leggings or jeans to be dressed up for dressy casual or anywhere!  I highly recommend this blouse.  I was afraid it would look like football shoulders, because I am sooooo short.  I am 5' even and I can tuck it in and it still looks great. Wish I had found this kind of blouse decades ago.  It looks good on short women, plus size women and average women.....and all around great design.  Don't hesitate to order this one.

I ordered the black and pink and they are so cute! Easy to throw on with a pair of jeans and look put together and comfy! I’m usually between a medium and large, ordered the large and it fits perfectly. I think the medium would have fit fine also but would have been more fitted.

Cute T-Shirt like blouse that does stretch well. With that being said if you have any type of tummy bulge be sure to wear leggings or Jeggins. This shirt is unforgiving in the mid section. I will keep it, but will not order another. Perfect for flat wash board stomach young or athletic women.

The fabric quality was good- soft with a little stretch, and the color was spot on! If you have broad shoulders- DON'T BUY THIS unless you want to look like a linebacker. The sleeves are a little extra than they appear in the model. I loved everything about it except that. If the shoulder poof was 1/2 the size, this would probably be my favorite shirt.

I really like this style tee shirt - so much that I came back and ordered 2 more in different colors.  I am usually a medium in Misses and a Large in Juniors, so after reading other reviews I ended up going with size large.  These shirts have all the comfort of a tee or sleep shirt but the elevated look that can be worn for work or going out.  It also washed like a dream and hang dried w/o any wrinkles.
